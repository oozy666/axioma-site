  <title>Privacy Policy — Mailer by Axioma</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how Mailer by Axioma ("the Application")
  accesses, uses, stores, and protects user data.
</p>

<h2>1. Application Overview</h2>
<p>
  Mailer by Axioma is a Telegram-based email automation tool that allows users
  to send emails from their own Google accounts using the Gmail API.
</p>

<h2>2. Google User Data Accessed</h2>
<p>
  The Application accesses the following Google user data via Google OAuth 2.0:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Gmail API (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send)</strong><br>
    Used solely to send emails on behalf of the authenticated user.
    The Application does not read, access, or analyze incoming emails,
    attachments, or mailbox contents.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Google Drive API (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file)</strong><br>
    Used only to access a spreadsheet file explicitly provided by the user,
    containing email recipient addresses for an email campaign.
    The Application does not access or analyze any other files on the user's Google Drive.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Provided Directly by the User</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Telegram user ID and username</li>
  <li>Email campaign content (subject and message body)</li>
  <li>Email recipient list (provided via a Google Spreadsheet)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
  User data is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the Application,
  which is sending email campaigns on behalf of the user.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email content is used to send messages via the Gmail API</li>
  <li>Recipient lists are processed temporarily to complete a mailing campaign</li>
  <li>Email campaign history (subject and message body) is stored to allow users
      to review previous campaigns</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
  OAuth access and refresh tokens are stored securely in an encrypted form
  using industry-standard encryption methods.
  Encryption keys are stored separately using environment variables.
</p>

<p>
  Email recipient lists are downloaded temporarily to the server only for the duration
  of an active mailing process and are permanently deleted immediately after the campaign
  is completed.
</p>

<p>
  Email campaign history (email subject and message body) is stored in a secure database
  and remains stored until user data is removed.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
  The Application does not sell, rent, or share Google user data with third parties.
  Data is used strictly to provide the Application’s functionality.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>
  OAuth tokens remain stored until the user revokes access to the Application.
  Users can revoke access at any time through their Google Account permissions page:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">
    https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Once access is revoked, the stored OAuth tokens become invalid and can no longer
  be used to access Google services.
</p>

<h2>8. User Control</h2>
<p>
  Users have full control over their Google account permissions and can revoke
  the Application’s access at any time through Google Account settings.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
